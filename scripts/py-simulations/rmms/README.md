# RMMS simulations

[Taken from [https://github.com/pareto-xyz/rmms-py](https://github.com/pareto-xyz/rmms-py/) and edited.]

This project is intended to investigate the replication of payoffs using custom Constant Function Market Makers (CFMMs) in the spirit of the 2021 paper from [Angeris, Evans and Chitra.](https://stanford.edu/~guillean/papers/rmms.pdf) For now it only focuses on the Covered Call replication. The project is organized as follows:

`modules` contains all the simulation toolkit. In particular:

- `modules/arb.py` implements the optimal arbitrage logic.
- `modules/cfmm.py` implements the actual CFMM pool logic.
- `modules/utils.py` contains a number of utility functions (math, geometric brownian motion generation).
- `modules/simulate.py` is simply the function used to run an individual simulation.
- `modules/optimize_fee.py` contains the logic required to find the optimal fee given some market and pool parameters.

`simulation.py` is a script used to run individual simulations whose parameters are specified in the `config.ini` file.

`optimal_fees_parallel.py` is a script to run an actual fee optimization routine for a prescribed parameter space (to be specified within the script itself).

`optimal_fees_visualization.py` is a script that generates a visual representation of the output of a fee optimization routine.

`error_distribution.py` is a script to plot the distribution of errors given some market and pool parameters for different fee regimes.

All the different functions and design choices are documented in a separate document.
